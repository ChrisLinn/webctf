  <p>
    The developer is using a cookie to prevent access to all of the levels. If you need to jump forward to skip to questions, feel free to edit the cookies to access them. This is a gimme, just try it out to access the next level.

    Hint: Check the libraries the app is loading. This isn't necessary, but may help.
